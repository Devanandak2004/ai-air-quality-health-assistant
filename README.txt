🌍 AI-Based Urban Air Quality Awareness & Health Risk Assistant
📌 Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered assistant that interprets Air Quality Index (AQI) data and provides simple, actionable health guidance for urban residents. It helps people understand pollution risks and take precautions, especially vulnerable groups like children and the elderly.

🎯 SDGs Addressed

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

SDG 13: Climate Action

🤖 How AI is Used

The system uses prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concepts to:

Classify air quality levels

Summarize health risks

Provide safety recommendations

Answer user questions conversationally

🧠 Prototype Workflow

AQI Data → AI Processing → Health Guidelines Retrieval → AI Chat Assistant → User Recommendations

⚖ Responsible AI

No personal medical data stored

Provides general advice, not diagnosis

Transparent AQI-based reasoning

Designed to support vulnerable groups fairly
