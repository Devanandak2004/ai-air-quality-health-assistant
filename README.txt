AI-Based Urban Air Quality Awareness & Health Risk Assistant
1. Introduction

Air pollution has become a major issue in urban areas, affecting the health and daily lives of millions of people. Although Air Quality Index (AQI) data is publicly available, most citizens do not understand what the numbers mean or how pollution levels impact their health. Vulnerable groups such as children, elderly individuals, and people with respiratory conditions are at higher risk but often lack clear, accessible guidance. This project proposes an AI-based assistant that converts AQI data into simple health advice and precautionary measures to support safer and more sustainable urban living.

2. SDG Alignment

This project supports the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being – By helping people reduce health risks caused by air pollution.

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities – By promoting awareness and safer living in urban environments.

SDG 13: Climate Action – By increasing public awareness of environmental conditions and pollution.

3. Problem Statement

Urban residents are frequently exposed to unhealthy air quality but lack the knowledge needed to interpret AQI values and take appropriate precautions. Existing AQI platforms mainly provide numerical data without personalized or easy-to-understand health guidance. As a result, individuals continue outdoor activities during high pollution periods, increasing the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular issues. There is a need for an intelligent system that translates complex environmental data into clear, actionable advice tailored to different user groups, especially vulnerable populations.

4. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is an AI-powered Air Quality Health Assistant that acts as a decision-support tool for citizens.

The system takes AQI values and basic user information (such as age group or health sensitivity) as input. Using AI, it:

Classifies the air quality level (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.)

Explains potential health impacts in simple language

Provides practical safety recommendations (e.g., limit outdoor activity, wear masks, close windows)

The assistant works in a conversational format, allowing users to ask questions like:

“Is it safe to exercise outside today?”

“What precautions should elderly people take when AQI is high?”

This transforms raw pollution data into meaningful guidance that people can use in daily life.

5. AI Technologies Used

The project demonstrates the use of the following AI concepts:

Prompt Engineering – To guide the AI in generating structured, safe, and relevant health advice

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Concept – To base responses on established air quality and health guidelines (e.g., WHO recommendations)

Conversational AI – To allow users to interact with the system in a chatbot-style format

Text Summarization – To convert complex environmental information into simple explanations

This is a conceptual prototype focused on AI workflow design rather than heavy coding.

6. System Workflow

The system operates in the following steps:

Input: AQI value and user type (e.g., child, elderly, healthy adult)

AI Processing:

Interpret AQI severity

Retrieve relevant health guidelines

Generate easy-to-understand advice

Output: Personalized safety recommendations and health risk explanation delivered through a chatbot-style assistant

7. Target Users

Residents of urban and pollution-prone cities

Children and elderly individuals

People with asthma or respiratory conditions

Daily commuters and outdoor workers

Schools and office communities

8. Expected Impact

The project aims to:

Improve public understanding of air pollution risks

Encourage safer daily decisions during high pollution periods

Reduce exposure of vulnerable groups to harmful air conditions

Promote environmental awareness and sustainable urban behavior

By turning environmental data into actionable knowledge, the system supports healthier communities and smarter city living.

9. Responsible AI Considerations

This project follows responsible AI principles:

Fairness: Advice is designed to support vulnerable populations without bias

Transparency: Recommendations are clearly linked to AQI levels

Privacy: No personal medical or sensitive user data is required

Ethics: The system provides general precautionary advice and does not offer medical diagnosis

10. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how AI can be used as a practical tool for sustainability and public health. By converting complex air quality data into simple, actionable guidance, the AI-Based Urban Air Quality Awareness & Health Risk Assistant empowers individuals to make safer decisions and supports the development of healthier, more sustainable cities.
